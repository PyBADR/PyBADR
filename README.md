# BDR.AI — Decision Intelligence Architecture

This GitHub profile represents **reference-grade decision intelligence systems**.

## What This Is
- Governed decision platforms
- Explicit authority and accountability enforcement
- Evaluation harnesses as release gates
- Architectures designed for regulatory, legal, and audit review

## What This Is NOT
- Notebooks
- ML demos
- Kaggle-style experiments
- Unbounded automation

## Reference System
The BDR Insurance Decision Intelligence Platform is a **frozen reference architecture** where:

- No decision executes without authority
- No release passes without evaluation
- No business logic exists in UI layers

Hugging Face Spaces are used strictly for **simulation and interface rendering**.  
All governance, authority, and execution logic lives in GitHub.

## Status
Architecture: **FROZEN**  
Mutability: **DISALLOWED**  
Purpose: **Reference & regulatory-grade systems**

This profile is intentionally minimal.
The architecture speaks for itself.
